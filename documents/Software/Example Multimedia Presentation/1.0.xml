They are very pretty birds which are easily identifiable through their arctic white body and black wing feathers which become more obvious during flight. These geese also come in a second colour (blue morph), a bluish-grey body with a white head. The colour of the goose is actually controlled by a single gene, with dark being partially dominant over white!</text>

Young goslings can sometimes be also found feeding on small insect larvae. In the autumn months, snow geese also enjoy various types of berries too. Like most other birds, these geese thoroughly enjoy munching on campus bird food, and will take advantage of any opportunity to scavenge some from passers by!</text>

Some snow geese migrate south, and spend the winter months on the Atlantic coast of the United States. They are a rare bird to see in the UK, with the University campus being one of very few places where visitors can set their eyes on these wonderful birds without having to cross the Atlantic! On campus, these birds are most commonly found grazing in the grassy area over the far side of the Derwent lake.</text>
