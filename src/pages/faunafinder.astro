    Fauna Finder is a mobile app developed by Penelope LTD, a group based in the
    University of York. The app is designed to help students and visitors
    identify and learn about the wildlife on campus.
    <br />
    <br />
    The app currently focuses on avian wildlife, with the intent to expand it to
    include other wildlife and animals in the future. The app acts as an identification
    tool to help students and visitors alike to find and learn more about the diverse
    campus wildlife.

    <br />
    The app features a location screen that allows users to select from the available
    university campuses. Once a campus is selected, the app updates the list of animals
    accordingly. The app provides users with a long list of birds, their respective
    names, and corresponding illustrations. Each bird species comes with detailed
    information that includes its scientific name, physical description, interesting
    facts, and natural habitat.
